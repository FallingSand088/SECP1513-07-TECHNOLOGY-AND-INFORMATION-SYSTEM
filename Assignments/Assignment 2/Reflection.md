### Reflection
---
The industry talk given by PPG Industries was insightful and gave us a glimpse of how a giant multinational company uses ICT to run their operations. The talk was delivered by PPG's IT team leaders which consisted of Miss Ai Ling Ooi (APAC IT Lead), Mr Derrick Tan (Data Analytics Manager), Mr Vijaykumar Dhandapani (Cloud Architecture Lead), Mr Patrick Thong (SAP Operations DTR Lead). From the talk, I was able to observe that in the current age, ICT roles move beyond simple support to become strategic necessities that determine a company's competitive advantage and future growth across every sector. This is done by driving innovation, optimizing workflows, and facilitating global communication. Besides that, I enjoyed the process of designing the poster using Canva and discussing with my groupmates about what should be added into the poster. An improvement that can be made is to have the talk physically rather than in hybrid mode as I believe it would make the talk more engaging and overcome issues such as lag and no audio.
