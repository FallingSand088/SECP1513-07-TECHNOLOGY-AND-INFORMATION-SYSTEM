### Reflection of Assignment 1
<br>
The visit to UTMDigital has been an amazing experience for me personally. I learned a lot about the different functions of the organisation, the departments they have, and the significance of UTMDigital in enhancing the academic and management operations of Universiti Teknologi Malaysia. One of the things that sparked interest in me was the self-operated server infrastructure that UTMDigital has which enables all the digital services provided to UTM students and staff. I also had a great time recording the video blog with my groupmates. We had a lot of discussions about how the blog should be recorded which in turn contributed to improving my communication skills. Moreover, I was able to practice my presentation skills as I was in charge in explaining about the visit and the organisational structure of UTMDigital. An improvement that I would like to suggest for the upcoming UTMDigital Open Day is to have the display booths at a bigger venue since the current venue was small and felt cramped.
